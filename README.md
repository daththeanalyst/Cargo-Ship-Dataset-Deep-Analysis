# Global Maritime Logistics: Tanker Fleet Data Analytics Project

## **Company Background**
You are a Data Analyst working at **Global Maritime Logistics**, a leading shipping firm specializing in the transportation of crude oil and other liquid bulk cargo across the world. The company operates a fleet of tankers that frequently travel through key shipping lanes and port hubs globally. As part of the company's strategic initiative to optimize operations and enhance decision-making, the leadership has requested a comprehensive data analytics project focused on tanker movements and operational efficiency.

## **Project Objective**
**Objective**: To analyze the movements and operational patterns of the companyâ€™s tanker fleet using Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The goal is to extract actionable insights that can help in route optimization, fuel efficiency, port performance assessment, and predictive modeling for Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA). These insights will support operational decisions, reduce costs, and improve the overall efficiency of the fleet.

## **Specific Goals**

- **Route Optimization**: Identify the most efficient shipping routes and highlight areas where the fleet can reduce fuel consumption and transit time.
  
- **Port Performance Analysis**: Evaluate the efficiency of key ports in terms of tanker turnaround time, congestion patterns, and docking efficiency.
  
- **Fleet Behavior Monitoring**: Track and analyze the behavior of the fleet, focusing on speed, course deviations, and potential inefficiencies.
  
- **Predictive Modeling**: Develop a predictive model to forecast ETA based on historical AIS data, helping operations teams to better manage schedules and customer expectations.
  
- **Data-Driven Decision Support**: Provide a robust, interactive dashboard in Power BI that the operations and logistics teams can use for real-time decision-making.

## **Project Workflow**

### **1. Data Collection and Preparation (SQL)**
- **Task**: Import AIS data into an SQL database.
- **Objective**: Store and preprocess large amounts of data efficiently.
- **Outcome**: Cleaned and structured datasets ready for analysis.

### **2. Data Analysis and Feature Engineering (Python)**
- **Task**: Extract cleaned data from SQL, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and engineer relevant features (e.g., average speed, distance traveled).
- **Objective**: Identify patterns and trends in the data, create new features that enhance the predictive power of models.
- **Outcome**: A set of actionable insights and a prepared dataset for modeling.

### **3. Predictive Modeling (Python)**
- **Task**: Develop and train machine learning models to predict ETA and other operational metrics.
- **Objective**: Provide predictive insights that can optimize scheduling and reduce delays.
- **Outcome**: A validated predictive model that can be deployed for real-time use.

### **4. Visualization and Reporting (Power BI)**
- **Task**: Create interactive dashboards that visualize key insights, including route efficiency, port performance, and predictive analytics.
- **Objective**: Enable stakeholders to make data-driven decisions using intuitive, real-time visualizations.
- **Outcome**: A comprehensive dashboard that supports the operations team with actionable insights.
